# Printer Management System

This project aims to create a comprehensive Printer Management System that allows users to seamlessly discover, manage, and send print jobs to printers over a local network. The system is designed to interact with printers, both wired and wireless, using a network-based approach, enabling devices within the same network to easily locate and communicate with available printers.

### Features

- **Printer Discovery**: Automatically discovers printers on the network using mDNS (multicast DNS), making it easy to detect available devices without manual configuration.
- **File Upload for Printing**: Users can upload files (.txt, .docx, .pdf) and send them to the selected printer using the printer’s IP address.
- **Network Communication**: The system supports printing over both Wi-Fi and Ethernet, making it flexible for various network setups.
- **Simple Interface**: A user-friendly web-based interface for selecting printers, uploading files, and monitoring the print status.

### Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js** with **Express.js** for the server and handling HTTP requests.
  - **Multer** for handling file uploads.
  - **dnssd** for network discovery of printers.
  - **child_process** for executing system commands like `arp -a` to discover network devices.
  
- **Frontend**:
  - **React** for building a dynamic user interface.
  - **Axios** for communicating with the backend API.
  
- **Networking**:
  - mDNS (multicast DNS) for device discovery in the network.
  - Support for wired and wireless connections.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/networkchaos/Printers.lol.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8080` to manage your printers and send print jobs.

### Future Work

- **Printer Status Monitoring**: Add functionality to check the status of printers (e.g., online, offline, busy).
- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication and access control for better security.
- **Support for More File Formats**: Extend the supported file types beyond the current .txt, .docx, and .pdf formats.
- **Advanced Print Features**: Implement options for managing print quality, paper size, etc.
